/**
 * Approach #3 (Optimal) [Accepted]
 * The total number of operations of the previous approach is sub-optimal. For example, the array which has all (except last) leading zeroes: [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1].How many write operations to the array? For the previous approach, it writes 0's n-1nâˆ’1 times, which is not necessary. We could have instead written just once. How? ..... By only fixing the non-0 element,i.e., 1.
 *
 * The optimal approach is again a subtle extension of above solution. A simple realization is if the current element is non-0, its' correct position can at best be it's current position or a position earlier. If it's the latter one, the current position will be eventually occupied by a non-0 ,or a 0, which lies at a index greater than 'cur' index. We fill the current position by 0 right away,so that unlike the previous solution, we don't need to come back here in next iteration.
 *
 * In other words, the code will maintain the following invariant:
 *
 * All elements before the slow pointer (lastNonZeroFoundAt) are non-zeroes.
 *
 * All elements between the current and slow pointer are zeroes.
 *
 * Therefore, when we encounter a non-zero element, we need to swap elements pointed by current and slow pointer, then advance both pointers. If it's zero element, we just advance current pointer.
 *
 * With this invariant in-place, it's easy to see that the algorithm will work.
 *
 * C++
 *
 * void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
 *     for (int lastNonZeroFoundAt = 0, cur = 0; cur < nums.size(); cur++) {
 *         if (nums[cur] != 0) {
 *             swap(nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt++], nums[cur]);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * Complexity Analysis
 *
 * Space Complexity : O(1)O(1). Only constant space is used.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)O(n). However, the total number of operations are optimal. The total operations (array writes) that code does is Number of non-0 elements.This gives us a much better best-case (when most of the elements are 0) complexity than last solution. However, the worst-case (when all elements are non-0) complexity for both the algorithms is same.
