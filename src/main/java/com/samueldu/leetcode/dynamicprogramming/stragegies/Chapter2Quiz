Multiple Choice Question
The three main components of the framework are:

The choice between bottom-up and top-down

The base cases

The recurrence relation

The number of dimensions

The time complexity

A data structure and a way of visiting each DP state

Redo

Submit
Correct.
Commit these to memory! Understanding the components of the framework allows us to approach dynamic programming problems in a step by step way.
